Fetches a new random photo.
Changes the background color to a randomly selected color from a predefined palette.

using the Open-Meteo API.

## Features
Fetches and displays the current temperature for Kyiv.
Uses the Open-Meteo API for real-time weather data.
A minimal and beginner-friendly implementation.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to learn the basics of iOS development and working with:
UIKit for building the user interface.
URLSession for making API requests.
JSONDecoder for decoding JSON data.

## How it works
The app sends a request to the Open-Meteo API for the current weather in Kyiv.
It decodes the response and displays the temperature on the screen.
