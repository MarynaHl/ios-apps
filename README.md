![combined_screenshots_aligned](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8ba5ad2-ce21-4584-a11f-71ecee2f38ec)

This is a simple iOS application written in Swift using UIKit. The app displays a random photo from the internet and allows the user to fetch a new photo with a button click. Additionally, the background color of the app changes dynamically with each button press.

## Features
Random Photo Display: Fetches a random photo from Lorem Picsum.
Dynamic Background: Changes the app's background color randomly with each button press.
Minimalist UI: Includes an image view and a button for interaction.
Asynchronous Networking: Uses URLSession for efficient photo fetching without blocking the UI.

## How It Works
Initial Setup: On launch, the app displays a random photo and sets the background color to pink.
Button Interaction: Tapping the "Random Photo" button:
Fetches a new random photo.
Changes the background color to a randomly selected color from a predefined palette.
